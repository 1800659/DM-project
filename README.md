## Project Scope

The primary focus of this project was to measure and compare the performance of two distinct database management systems: a relational database management system (**MariaDB**) and a graph database management system (**Neo4j**). To achieve this, we selected and executed a set of 20 queries to evaluate their execution times on both database systems.

## Project Components

### Data Selection and Preparation:

We chose a comprehensive and structured football dataset sourced from Transfermarkt, available on Kaggle through this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores), encompassing data on games, clubs, players, competitions, market valuations, and player appearances. This dataset was cleaned, organized, and used for our experiments.

### Database Systems:

- **MariaDB**: Selected as our relational database management system.
- **Neo4j**: Chosen as our graph database management system.

### Query Execution and Performance Evaluation:

We designed Python scripts to execute the selected queries on both MariaDB and Neo4j and to calculate the average execution time. These scripts measured the execution time of each query and stored the results for analysis. The performance of both database systems was evaluated based on query execution times. The results were presented in the project slides and are available for reference.
